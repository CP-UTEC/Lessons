<div class="topic">Contribution technique</div>

This technique can help to reduce long computations with lot of variables. This
kind of problems are usually of couting and combinatorics.

**Problem:** You will receive $n$ points on the plane. Find how many
non-degenerate triangles you can build with these points as vertices.

$$1 \leq n \leq 2000$$

First, we note that we can implement a $O(n^3)$ solution, but we need something
better. Then, we remember that if we have three no collinear points, we have
a triangule. Moreover, two different points form a line. Using these ideas, we
can fix a point and a line that pass throught it. If we fix the point 'A' of
a triangle, the second vertex 'B' can be any other point that pass thought this
line. If $x$ points pass on this line, then $n - x$ points are outside, so 'C' has $n - x$ options. So, if we fix a point and a line that pass though it we know that this line adds $(x - 1) \cdot (n -x)$  to the answer. Then, we can use brute force over it. Nevertheless, we are doing double couting (each point is counted 3 times and in two directions). So, the answer is divided by 6.

A line is mapped using its direction vector, but we need to work with integers.
Check the implementation for more details.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

map<pair<int, int>, int> tri[maxN];

int main() {
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
  }
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
      if (i == j) {
        continue;
      }
      int vx = x[i] - x[j];
      int vy = y[i] - y[j];
      int g = __gcd(abs(vx), abs(vy));
      vx /= g;
      vy /= g;
      if (vx < 0 or vx == 0 and vy < 0) {
        vx = -vx;
        vy = -vy;
      }
      tri[i][{vx, vy}] += 1;
    }
  }
  long long ans = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    for (auto v: tri[i]) {
      ans += (n - 1 - v.second) * v.second; 
    }
  }
  cout << ans / 6 << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

<div class="topic">Seaching over all the permutations</div>

There are problems where you need to search over all the permutations of $[1, 2, \dots, n]$ in order to find a solution. You can do it using the STL. For example:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main () {
  int n = 4;
  vector <int> arr(n);
  iota(begin(arr), end(arr), 1);
  // the array must be sorted or you won't get all the permutations
  do {
    for (int arr_i: arr) {
      cout << arr_i << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';
  } while (next_permutation(begin(arr), end(arr)));
  return (0);
}
```
The above code has complexity $O(n! n)$.

Now, let's see this technique in [this problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/910/C).

**Solution:**

Note that $abcdefghij$ can be mapped to $0123456789$. Then, we can search the
answer in $O(\Sigma! n)$ where $\Sigma = 10$. But $1 \leq n \leq 1000$, so this
approach would be a $TLE$ veredict. Nevertheless, we can use a counter of
frecuencies for each digit and then get the total sum using it. In this way we
have an $O(\Sigma! LS)$  solution, where $S = 10 \land L \leq 6$. Here $L$ is the
maximum number of digits.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

const int LEN = 6, SIGMA = 10;

int cnt[LEN + 1][SIGMA + 1], val[SIGMA + 1];
bool invalid[SIGMA + 1];

int main () {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    string number;
    cin >> number;
    invalid[number[0] - 'a'] = true;
    int sz = number.size();
    for (int j = 0; j < sz; j++) {
      cnt[LEN - sz + j][number[j] - 'a']++;
    }
  }
  string sigma = "abcdefghij";
  int ans = INT_MAX;
  do {
    if (invalid[sigma[0] - 'a']) continue;
    int p = 0;
    for (const char ch: sigma) val[ch - 'a'] = p++;
    int sum = 0, carry = 0, power = 1;
    for (int i = LEN - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      int ac = 0;
      for (int j = 0; j < SIGMA; j++) {
        ac += cnt[i][j] * val[j];
      }
      ac += carry;
      sum = sum + power * (ac % 10);
      power *= 10;
      carry = ac / 10;
    }
    while (carry) {
      sum = sum + power * (carry % 10);
      power *= 10;
      carry /= 10;
    }
    ans = min(ans, sum);
  } while (next_permutation(begin(sigma), end(sigma)));
  cout << ans << endl;
  return (0);
}
```

<div class="topic">Binary representation</div>
The computers only manage bits when these are working. So, numbers are represented as bit strings. In this case, we use bit representation of a number for working inside of competitive programming problem.

Remember, bit representation is a number in base 2.

  $X = c_02^0+ c_12^1 + c_22^2 ... + c_k2^k$

In C++, the int and long long uses 32-bits and 64-bits, respectively.

For example, the number 42 is

00000000000000000000000000101010

The leftmost bit, the most significant bit, is the sign of the number. It is 0 for nonnegative numbers and 1 for negative number. The remaining 31 o 63 bits are used for the magnitude of the number. The technique used is called Two's complement, where we work with nonegative numbers and if we would like to work with negative numbers first inverting all the bits in the number, and then increasing the number by one.

For example, the number -42: 

First, inverting all the bits.

11111111111111111111111111010101

Then, increasing by one.

11111111111111111111111111010110

So, the interval for integers of type int is 

$[ -2^{31},2^{31}-1]$

and for long long is

$[ -2^{63},2^{63}-1]$

Warning with unsigned int and unsigned long.

With all this, we can use integers to represent a lightweight small set of Boolean values. All set operations
then involve only the bitwise manipulation of the corresponding integer, which makes
it a much more efficient choice when compared with the C++ STL vector<bool>,
bitset, or set<int> options.

We invite you all to look what happen in Python's integers. [Open Link](https://mortada.net/can-integer-operations-overflow-in-python.html)

<div class="topic">Bitwise operations</div>

First, we need to recall how bit operations work.

The first operator is **AND**. Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of A **and** of B is 1, otherwise is 0. Both at Python or C++ AND operator is represented like the symbol **\&**.
<div class="rows text-center">
![](./images/class-07/andoperator.png)
</div>

The second operator is **OR**. Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bit of A AND of B is 0, otherwise it's 1. Both at Python or C++ OR operator is represeted like the symbol **\|**.
<div class="rows text-center">
![](./images/class-07/oroperator.png)
</div>

The third operator is **XOR**. Each bit of the output is the same as the corresponding bit in A if that bit in B is 0, and it's the complement of the bit in A if that bit in B is 1. Both at Python or C++ XOR operator is represented like the symbol **\^**.
<div class="rows text-center">
![](./images/class-07/xoroperator.png)
</div>

Finally, complement operator or **NOT**. Return 1 the bit in A is 0 and 0 if the bit is 1. Both at Python or C++ NOT operator is represented like the symbol **\~**.
<div class="rows text-center">
![](./images/class-07/notA.png)
</div>

**Check if i-th bit of n is on:**

In 0-based indexing from right.

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void  main() {
  int n=48; //00000000000000000000000000110000
  int i=4; // (1<<4) is equal to 00000000000000000000000000010000

  if(n & 1<<i)
    cout<<"It's on"<<endl; 
  else
    cout<<"It's off"<<endl;

  return 0;  
}
```

**To multiply/divide and integer by 2:**

Shift/right left operation.

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void  main() {
  int n=7; 00000000000000000000000000000111
  n = n << 1; //n is 14, 00000000000000000000000000001110
  n <<= 1; //now, n is 28, 00000000000000000000000000011100
  n >>= 1; // n becomes 14

  return 0;  
}
```

**To set on the i-th bit:**

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void  main() {

  int n=8;
  n = n | (1<<5);
  n |= 1<<2; //Now n is 40
  cout<<n<<endl; //Here n is 44

  return 0;  
}
```

**To set off the i-th bit:**

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void  main() {

  int n=44;
  n = n & ~(1<<5); 
  n &= ~(1<<2);  //Now n is 12
  cout<<n<<endl; //Here n is 8

  return 0;  
}
```

**To toggle the i-th bit:**

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void  main() {

  int n=14;
  n = n ^ (1<<1); //Now n is 15
  n ^= (1<<1); //Now n is 14 again 
  cout<<n<<endl;

  return 0;  
}
```

**To get the value of the least significant bit that is on:**
First from the right

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void  main() {

  int n=14;
  int leastbit;
  leastbit = n & (-n); 
  // t is 2
  cout<<t<<endl;

  return 0;  
}
```

**To turn on all bits in a set of size n.**

Be careful with overflows.

```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void  main() {

  //set of size 4
  int n=4;
  int setn = (1<<n)-1; 
  //setn is 15, but its binary representing is 1111
  cout<<setn<<endl;

  return 0;  
}
```

**Note:**
There exists built functions of G++ for counting how many bits are on.
```c++

//For example

int main(){
  int x=12;
  cout<<__builtin_popcount(x)<<endl; // 2, the number of 1s in the number 
  cout<<__builtin_parity(x)<<endl; // 0, the parity of a number 
  cout<<__builtin_clz(x)<<endl; // 28, the number of zeros at the beginning  
  cout<<__builtin_ctz(x)<<endl; // 2, the numberz of zeros at the end   

// Also, for kind of variables the functions are changed lightly
  cout<<__builtin_popcount(x)<<endl; //for integers
  cout<<__builtin_popcountll(1ll*x)<<endl; //for long long 
  return 0;
}

```
We invite all of you  to visite [Built Funcionts of GCC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/builtin-functions-gcc-compiler/).


**Simple example**

Now, we continue with a simple example where everyone can apply bitwise operations. It is frequent using bitmask with a number n for permutations or set problems. Please look the following link. [Open Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1097/B)

In this problem, we start pointing zero and we need to check if it is possible rotate the lock's wheel in some angles in clockwise or counterclockwise way and again point at zero.

So, we use bitwise for represent a set of size n. If the i-th bit is on we rotate the lock's wheel in clockwise way, otherwise we rotate in counterclockwise way.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin>>n;
  int angles[n];

  for(int &i:angles)
    cin>>i;

  int acum;

  for(int i=0;i<(1<<n);i++){
    acum=0;
    for(int j=0;j<n;j++){
      if(i & (1<<j))
        acum+=angles[j];
      else
        acum-=angles[j];

    if((acum%360)==0){
      cout<<"YES\n";
      break;
    }
  }

  if((acum%360)!=0)
    cout<<"NO\n";
  
  return 0;
  }
```

<div class="topic">Brute force on bitmasks</div>

There are some kind of problem where you have $n$ items and each item can be taken or not. Then, you can represent the states of the problems as $S = \{ b_1b_2b_3 \dots b_n: b_i = 0 \lor b_i = 1\}$. That is, if $b_i = 0$ we are not taken the $i-th$ element, else we are taking it. And we can use bitmasks to simulate $S$.

Let's see how to use it in [this problem](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1060).

If you select the same cell two times, the field is not changed. Then, we only
care if each element is taken or not. Then we can simulate all the options in
$O(n^2 2^n)$ where $n=16$.

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main () {
  int dr[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
  int dc[] = {0, 0, 1, 0, -1};
  vector <string> grid(4);
  vector <string> black(4, string(4, 'b'));
  vector <string> white(4, string(4, 'w'));
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) cin >> grid[i];
  int ans = INT_MAX;
  for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << 16); mask++) {
    vector <string> tmp = grid;
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int bit = 0; bit < 16; bit++) {
      if ((mask >> bit) & 1) {
        cnt++;
        int r = bit / 4;
        int c = bit % 4;
        for (int d = 0; d < 5; d++) {
          int nr = r + dr[d];
          int nc = c + dc[d];
          if (0 <= min(nr, nc) and max(nr, nc) < 4) {
            if (tmp[nr][nc] == 'b') tmp[nr][nc] = 'w';
            else tmp[nr][nc] = 'b';
          }
        }
      }
    }
    if (tmp == black or tmp == white) {
      ans = min(ans, cnt);
    }
  }
  if (ans == INT_MAX) puts("Impossible");
  else cout << ans << endl;
  return (0);
}
```
